This is demonstration of Spring Boot with Basic Authentication

The server uses port 8090 (Please feel free change)

You may want to use POSTMAN for checking your response. One thing to note here when you are switching between no Auth and Basic Auth in Postman,
make surr you are clearing cookies. 

To access this application in POSTMAN you will have to use 

https://localhost:8090/security url.

SecurityConfig may not be required as I have commented out the code to demonstrate that it is one way to
configure the security.
